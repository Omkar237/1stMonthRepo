a view is a virtual table that is based on the result of 
a SELECT query. It does not store the data itself but provides a way 
to represent the result of a query as if it were a table. Views can 
simplify complex queries, abstract away complexity, and provide a 
level of security by restricting access to certain columns or rows.
